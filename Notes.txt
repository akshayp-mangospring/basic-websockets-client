Redux is used for complex React App's centralized state management.

Why to use Redux Toolkit?
  The Redux website now itself recommends the usage of Redux Toolkit in it's own docs.
  Redux toolkit is an improvisation to Redux. It's much more organised, cleaner.
  It also has support for immutability out of the box, it uses `immer.js` for handling of immutable state.
  It also has got support for Redux middleware out of the box. So, we don't need to add `redux-thunk` separately. It has got `createAsyncThunk` in it.
  The newer version has got very less boilerplate code involved in it.
  The most fun fact is that it now supports the usage of Hooks just like ReactJS.
  So, we must now move on from Redux to Redux Toolkit.
